# sprialator
An experiment I began with by leveraging ChatGPT. 
First commit was made with about an hour of back and forth with the machine 
 We'll see where it goes. 

## Running the code: 
* Clone the repo.  `git clone git@github.com:CollectionOfAtoms/sprialator.git`
* Open `pinwheel.html` with the browser of your choise (I use chrome)

## Controls
* `up` and `dowv` increment the size of the dots near the middle of the screen
* `shift` and `up, down` increment the size of the dots near the edge of the screen
* `number keys` adjust the number of spirals from 1-9
* `left and right arrows` adjust the frequency of the colors as a function of radius.
* `r` toggles control where `up` and `down` adust the radius from center at which the larger size dot is dominant
* `k` toggles control where `up` and `down` adust how gradually the radius goes from inner dot size to outer dot size
